# Context-Aware-Question-Answering-System
Develop a Python-based system that, given a document, can respond to user queries by extracting relevant information from the document using Natural Language Processing techniques.

This repository contains implementations of some of the most important papers for Question Answering. The implementations are in the form of tutorials and are roughly annotations of the said papers. This repository might be helpful for those who know the basics of deep learning and NLP, want to get started with reading slightly complex papers and see how they are implemented. This repository also assumes some familiarity with PyTorch basics, although I have tried my best to break everything down in simple terms.
